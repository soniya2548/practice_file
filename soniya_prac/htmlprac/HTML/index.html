        <h3>Kettlebells</h3>
        <h4>How it works</h4>
        <img src="images/kettlebells.jpg" />
        <p>
            Burn up to 400 calories in 20 minutes: That's what you'll get from a kettlebell workout.

            A kettlebell looks like a cast-iron cannonball with a handle on top. They come in various weights.
            You'll use them as you do things like lunges, lifts, and shoulder presses.

            The workout gets your heart pumping and uses up to 20 calories per minute: about as much as running
            a 6-minute mile.

            Kettlebell workouts offer a lot of flexibility. You can include a few of the moves in your own
            workout or do a dedicated kettlebell workout a few times a week.

            Sign up for a kettlebell class at the gym or online to learn how to do the moves safely. It won't
            take long to understand why celebrities like Jennifer Aniston, Jessica Biel, and Katherine Heigl
            are huge fans of kettlebell workouts.

        <h3>Aerobic</h3>
        <img src="images/aerobics.jpg">
        <p>
            By definition, aerobic exercise means “with oxygen.” Your breathing and heart rate will increase during
            aerobic activities. Aerobic exercise helps keep your heart, lungs, and circulatory system healthy.

            Aerobic exercise differs from anaerobic exercise. Anaerobic exercises, such as weightlifting or sprinting,
            involve quick bursts of energy. They're performed at maximum effort for a short time. This is unlike aerobic
            exercises. You perform aerobic exercises for a sustained period of time.

            Read on to learn more about aerobic exercises you can try at home and the gym. And remember, always talk
            with your doctor before beginning a new aerobic exercise routine.

        <h3>Lunges</h3>
        <img src="images/lunges.jfif">
        <p>
            The lunge is a multi-joint exercise that can help tone and strengthen many muscles in the lower body. This
            includes the quads (front of the thighs), hamstrings (back of the thighs), glutes (buttocks), and calves
            (back of the lower leg).

            Your hip flexors are stretched during the lunge. This improves their flexibility and counteracts the
            shortening and tightening that can happen when you sit for long periods.1 You also engage your core muscles
            for stability, which can help you maintain balance2 and prevent injuries.3

            Another benefit of lunges is that they are a functional exercise. This means that they mimic actions you
            take throughout daily life, such as when picking something up from the floor. Since lunges work large
            lower-body muscle groups, it may even improve your metabolism.4

            When compared to other lower-body exercises such as squats, the split stance used in lunges changes the load
            on your body, allowing you to work each leg more independently.
