                        <p>
                            Robotic Surgery is an advanced form of minimally invasive (key hole) surgery for various chest
                            diseases which involves the use of the state of art Surgical Robot to perform surgery inside the
                            chest using 3-5 small (1-1.5 cm) cuts instead of conventional open surgery.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The robotic system consists of three main parts

                                It is the command centre which the lead surgeon uses to perform the surgery. It has a
